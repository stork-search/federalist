        9-10: The Union as a Safeguard Against Domestic Faction and Insurrection
      </h1>

      <h2 id="9">9</h2>
      <aside>Alexander Hamilton</aside>

      <p>To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p>
        A FIRM Union will be of the utmost moment to the peace and liberty of
        the States, as a barrier against domestic faction and insurrection. It
        is impossible to read the history of the petty republics of Greece and
        Italy without feeling sensations of horror and disgust at the
        distractions with which they were continually agitated, and at the rapid
        succession of revolutions by which they were kept in a state of
        perpetual vibration between the extremes of tyranny and anarchy. If they
        exhibit occasional calms, these only serve as short-lived contrast to
        the furious storms that are to succeed. If now and then intervals of
        felicity open to view, we behold them with a mixture of regret, arising
        from the reflection that the pleasing scenes before us are soon to be
        overwhelmed by the tempestuous waves of sedition and party rage. If
        momentary rays of glory break forth from the gloom, while they dazzle us
        with a transient and fleeting brilliancy, they at the same time admonish
        us to lament that the vices of government should pervert the direction
        and tarnish the lustre of those bright talents and exalted endowments
        for which the favored soils that produced them have been so justly
        celebrated.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the disorders that disfigure the annals of those republics the
        advocates of despotism have drawn arguments, not only against the forms
        of republican government, but against the very principles of civil
        liberty. They have decried all free government as inconsistent with the
        order of society, and have indulged themselves in malicious exultation
        over its friends and partisans. Happily for mankind, stupendous fabrics
        reared on the basis of liberty, which have flourished for ages, have, in
        a few glorious instances, refuted their gloomy sophisms. And, I trust,
        America will be the broad and solid foundation of other edifices, not
        less magnificent, which will be equally permanent monuments of their
        errors.
      </p>

      <p>
        But it is not to be denied that the portraits they have sketched of
        republican government were too just copies of the originals from which
        they were taken. If it had been found impracticable to have devised
        models of a more perfect structure, the enlightened friends to liberty
        would have been obliged to abandon the cause of that species of
        government as indefensible. The science of politics, however, like most
        other sciences, has received great improvement. The efficacy of various
        principles is now well understood, which were either not known at all,
        or imperfectly known to the ancients. The regular distribution of power
        into distinct departments; the introduction of legislative balances and
        checks; the institution of courts composed of judges holding their
        offices during good behavior; the representation of the people in the
        legislature by deputies of their own election: these are wholly new
        discoveries, or have made their principal progress towards perfection in
        modern times. They are means, and powerful means, by which the
        excellences of republican government may be retained and its
        imperfections lessened or avoided. To this catalogue of circumstances
        that tend to the amelioration of popular systems of civil government, I
        shall venture, however novel it may appear to some, to add one more, on
        a principle which has been made the foundation of an objection to the
        new Constitution; I mean the ENLARGEMENT of the ORBIT within which such
        systems are to revolve, either in respect to the dimensions of a single
        State or to the consolidation of several smaller States into one great
        Confederacy. The latter is that which immediately concerns the object
        under consideration. It will, however, be of use to examine the
        principle in its application to a single State, which shall be attended
        to in another place.
      </p>

      <p>
        The utility of a Confederacy, as well to suppress faction and to guard
        the internal tranquillity of States, as to increase their external force
        and security, is in reality not a new idea. It has been practiced upon
        in different countries and ages, and has received the sanction of the
        most approved writers on the subject of politics. The opponents of the
        plan proposed have, with great assiduity, cited and circulated the
        observations of Montesquieu on the necessity of a contracted territory
        for a republican government. But they seem not to have been apprised of
        the sentiments of that great man expressed in another part of his work,
        nor to have adverted to the consequences of the principle to which they
        subscribe with such ready acquiescence.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Montesquieu recommends a small extent for republics, the standards
        he had in view were of dimensions far short of the limits of almost
        every one of these States. Neither Virginia, Massachusetts,
        Pennsylvania, New York, North Carolina, nor Georgia can by any means be
        compared with the models from which he reasoned and to which the terms
        of his description apply. If we therefore take his ideas on this point
        as the criterion of truth, we shall be driven to the alternative either
        of taking refuge at once in the arms of monarchy, or of splitting
        ourselves into an infinity of little, jealous, clashing, tumultuous
        commonwealths, the wretched nurseries of unceasing discord, and the
        miserable objects of universal pity or contempt. Some of the writers who
        have come forward on the other side of the question seem to have been
        aware of the dilemma; and have even been bold enough to hint at the
        division of the larger States as a desirable thing. Such an infatuated
        policy, such a desperate expedient, might, by the multiplication of
        petty offices, answer the views of men who possess not qualifications to
        extend their influence beyond the narrow circles of personal intrigue,
        but it could never promote the greatness or happiness of the people of
        America.
      </p>

      <p>
        Referring the examination of the principle itself to another place, as
        has been already mentioned, it will be sufficient to remark here that,
        in the sense of the author who has been most emphatically quoted upon
        the occasion, it would only dictate a reduction of the SIZE of the more
        considerable MEMBERS of the Union, but would not militate against their
        being all comprehended in one confederate government. And this is the
        true question, in the discussion of which we are at present interested.
      </p>

      <p>
        So far are the suggestions of Montesquieu from standing in opposition to
        a general Union of the States, that he explicitly treats of a
        CONFEDERATE REPUBLIC as the expedient for extending the sphere of
        popular government, and reconciling the advantages of monarchy with
        those of republicanism.
      </p>

      <p>
        "It is very probable,'' (says he1) "that mankind would have been obliged
        at length to live constantly under the government of a single person,
        had they not contrived a kind of constitution that has all the internal
        advantages of a republican, together with the external force of a
        monarchical government. I mean a CONFEDERATE REPUBLIC.
      </p>

      <p>
        "This form of government is a convention by which several smaller STATES
        agree to become members of a larger ONE, which they intend to form. It
        is a kind of assemblage of societies that constitute a new one, capable
        of increasing, by means of new associations, till they arrive to such a
        degree of power as to be able to provide for the security of the united
        body.
      </p>

      <p>
        "A republic of this kind, able to withstand an external force, may
        support itself without any internal corruptions. The form of this
        society prevents all manner of inconveniences.
      </p>

      <p>
        "If a single member should attempt to usurp the supreme authority, he
        could not be supposed to have an equal authority and credit in all the
        confederate states. Were he to have too great influence over one, this
        would alarm the rest. Were he to subdue a part, that which would still
        remain free might oppose him with forces independent of those which he
        had usurped and overpower him before he could be settled in his
        usurpation.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Should a popular insurrection happen in one of the confederate states
        the others are able to quell it. Should abuses creep into one part, they
        are reformed by those that remain sound. The state may be destroyed on
        one side, and not on the other; the confederacy may be dissolved, and
        the confederates preserve their sovereignty.
      </p>

      <p>
        "As this government is composed of small republics, it enjoys the
        internal happiness of each; and with respect to its external situation,
        it is possessed, by means of the association, of all the advantages of
        large monarchies.''
      </p>

      <p>
        I have thought it proper to quote at length these interesting passages,
        because they contain a luminous abridgment of the principal arguments in
        favor of the Union, and must effectually remove the false impressions
        which a misapplication of other parts of the work was calculated to
        make. They have, at the same time, an intimate connection with the more
        immediate design of this paper; which is, to illustrate the tendency of
        the Union to repress domestic faction and insurrection.
      </p>

      <p>
        A distinction, more subtle than accurate, has been raised between a
        CONFEDERACY and a CONSOLIDATION of the States. The essential
        characteristic of the first is said to be, the restriction of its
        authority to the members in their collective capacities, without
        reaching to the individuals of whom they are composed. It is contended
        that the national council ought to have no concern with any object of
        internal administration. An exact equality of suffrage between the
        members has also been insisted upon as a leading feature of a
        confederate government. These positions are, in the main, arbitrary;
        they are supported neither by principle nor precedent. It has indeed
        happened, that governments of this kind have generally operated in the
        manner which the distinction taken notice of, supposes to be inherent in
        their nature; but there have been in most of them extensive exceptions
        to the practice, which serve to prove, as far as example will go, that
        there is no absolute rule on the subject. And it will be clearly shown
        in the course of this investigation that as far as the principle
        contended for has prevailed, it has been the cause of incurable disorder
        and imbecility in the government.
      </p>

      <p>
        The definition of a CONFEDERATE REPUBLIC seems simply to be "an
        assemblage of societies,'' or an association of two or more states into
        one state. The extent, modifications, and objects of the federal
        authority are mere matters of discretion. So long as the separate
        organization of the members be not abolished; so long as it exists, by a
        constitutional necessity, for local purposes; though it should be in
        perfect subordination to the general authority of the union, it would
        still be, in fact and in theory, an association of states, or a
        confederacy. The proposed Constitution, so far from implying an
        abolition of the State governments, makes them constituent parts of the
        national sovereignty, by allowing them a direct representation in the
        Senate, and leaves in their possession certain exclusive and very
        important portions of sovereign power. This fully corresponds, in every
        rational import of the terms, with the idea of a federal government.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the Lycian confederacy, which consisted of twenty-three CITIES or
        republics, the largest were entitled to THREE votes in the COMMON
        COUNCIL, those of the middle class to TWO, and the smallest to ONE. The
        COMMON COUNCIL had the appointment of all the judges and magistrates of
        the respective CITIES. This was certainly the most, delicate species of
        interference in their internal administration; for if there be any thing
        that seems exclusively appropriated to the local jurisdictions, it is
        the appointment of their own officers. Yet Montesquieu, speaking of this
        association, says: "Were I to give a model of an excellent Confederate
        Republic, it would be that of Lycia.'' Thus we perceive that the
        distinctions insisted upon were not within the contemplation of this
        enlightened civilian; and we shall be led to conclude, that they are the
        novel refinements of an erroneous theory.

      <p>To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p>
        AMONG the numerous advantages promised by a well-constructed Union, none
        deserves to be more accurately developed than its tendency to break and
        control the violence of faction. The friend of popular governments never
        finds himself so much alarmed for their character and fate, as when he
        contemplates their propensity to this dangerous vice. He will not fail,
        therefore, to set a due value on any plan which, without violating the
        principles to which he is attached, provides a proper cure for it. The
        instability, injustice, and confusion introduced into the public
        councils, have, in truth, been the mortal diseases under which popular
        governments have everywhere perished; as they continue to be the
        favorite and fruitful topics from which the adversaries to liberty
        derive their most specious declamations. The valuable improvements made
        by the American constitutions on the popular models, both ancient and
        modern, cannot certainly be too much admired; but it would be an
        unwarrantable partiality, to contend that they have as effectually
        obviated the danger on this side, as was wished and expected. Complaints
        are everywhere heard from our most considerate and virtuous citizens,
        equally the friends of public and private faith, and of public and
        personal liberty, that our governments are too unstable, that the public
        good is disregarded in the conflicts of rival parties, and that measures
        are too often decided, not according to the rules of justice and the
        rights of the minor party, but by the superior force of an interested
        and overbearing majority. However anxiously we may wish that these
        complaints had no foundation, the evidence, of known facts will not
        permit us to deny that they are in some degree true. It will be found,
        indeed, on a candid review of our situation, that some of the distresses
        under which we labor have been erroneously charged on the operation of
        our governments; but it will be found, at the same time, that other
        causes will not alone account for many of our heaviest misfortunes; and,
        particularly, for that prevailing and increasing distrust of public
        engagements, and alarm for private rights, which are echoed from one end
        of the continent to the other. These must be chiefly, if not wholly,
        effects of the unsteadiness and injustice with which a factious spirit
        has tainted our public administrations.
      </p>

      <p>
        By a faction, I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a
        majority or a minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some
        common impulse of passion, or of interest, adversed to the rights of
        other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the
        community.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are two methods of curing the mischiefs of faction: the one, by
        removing its causes; the other, by controlling its effects.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are again two methods of removing the causes of faction: the one,
        by destroying the liberty which is essential to its existence; the
        other, by giving to every citizen the same opinions, the same passions,
        and the same interests.
      </p>

      <p>
        It could never be more truly said than of the first remedy, that it was
        worse than the disease. Liberty is to faction what air is to fire, an
        aliment without which it instantly expires. But it could not be less
        folly to abolish liberty, which is essential to political life, because
        it nourishes faction, than it would be to wish the annihilation of air,
        which is essential to animal life, because it imparts to fire its
        destructive agency.
      </p>

      <p>
        The second expedient is as impracticable as the first would be unwise.
        As long as the reason of man continues fallible, and he is at liberty to
        exercise it, different opinions will be formed. As long as the
        connection subsists between his reason and his self-love, his opinions
        and his passions will have a reciprocal influence on each other; and the
        former will be objects to which the latter will attach themselves. The
        diversity in the faculties of men, from which the rights of property
        originate, is not less an insuperable obstacle to a uniformity of
        interests. The protection of these faculties is the first object of
        government. From the protection of different and unequal faculties of
        acquiring property, the possession of different degrees and kinds of
        property immediately results; and from the influence of these on the
        sentiments and views of the respective proprietors, ensues a division of
        the society into different interests and parties.
      </p>

      <p>
        The latent causes of faction are thus sown in the nature of man; and we
        see them everywhere brought into different degrees of activity,
        according to the different circumstances of civil society. A zeal for
        different opinions concerning religion, concerning government, and many
        other points, as well of speculation as of practice; an attachment to
        different leaders ambitiously contending for pre-eminence and power; or
        to persons of other descriptions whose fortunes have been interesting to
        the human passions, have, in turn, divided mankind into parties,
        inflamed them with mutual animosity, and rendered them much more
        disposed to vex and oppress each other than to co-operate for their
        common good. So strong is this propensity of mankind to fall into mutual
        animosities, that where no substantial occasion presents itself, the
        most frivolous and fanciful distinctions have been sufficient to kindle
        their unfriendly passions and excite their most violent conflicts. But
        the most common and durable source of factions has been the various and
        unequal distribution of property. Those who hold and those who are
        without property have ever formed distinct interests in society. Those
        who are creditors, and those who are debtors, fall under a like
        discrimination. A landed interest, a manufacturing interest, a
        mercantile interest, a moneyed interest, with many lesser interests,
        grow up of necessity in civilized nations, and divide them into
        different classes, actuated by different sentiments and views. The
        regulation of these various and interfering interests forms the
        principal task of modern legislation, and involves the spirit of party
        and faction in the necessary and ordinary operations of the government.
      </p>

      <p>
        No man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause, because his interest
        would certainly bias his judgment, and, not improbably, corrupt his
        integrity. With equal, nay with greater reason, a body of men are unfit
        to be both judges and parties at the same time; yet what are many of the
        most important acts of legislation, but so many judicial determinations,
        not indeed concerning the rights of single persons, but concerning the
        rights of large bodies of citizens? And what are the different classes
        of legislators but advocates and parties to the causes which they
        determine? Is a law proposed concerning private debts? It is a question
        to which the creditors are parties on one side and the debtors on the
        other. Justice ought to hold the balance between them. Yet the parties
        are, and must be, themselves the judges; and the most numerous party,
        or, in other words, the most powerful faction must be expected to
        prevail. Shall domestic manufactures be encouraged, and in what degree,
        by restrictions on foreign manufactures? are questions which would be
        differently decided by the landed and the manufacturing classes, and
        probably by neither with a sole regard to justice and the public good.
        The apportionment of taxes on the various descriptions of property is an
        act which seems to require the most exact impartiality; yet there is,
        perhaps, no legislative act in which greater opportunity and temptation
        are given to a predominant party to trample on the rules of justice.
        Every shilling with which they overburden the inferior number, is a
        shilling saved to their own pockets.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is in vain to say that enlightened statesmen will be able to adjust
        these clashing interests, and render them all subservient to the public
        good. Enlightened statesmen will not always be at the helm. Nor, in many
        cases, can such an adjustment be made at all without taking into view
        indirect and remote considerations, which will rarely prevail over the
        immediate interest which one party may find in disregarding the rights
        of another or the good of the whole.
      </p>

      <p>
        The inference to which we are brought is, that the CAUSES of faction
        cannot be removed, and that relief is only to be sought in the means of
        controlling its EFFECTS.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a faction consists of less than a majority, relief is supplied by the
        republican principle, which enables the majority to defeat its sinister
        views by regular vote. It may clog the administration, it may convulse
        the society; but it will be unable to execute and mask its violence
        under the forms of the Constitution. When a majority is included in a
        faction, the form of popular government, on the other hand, enables it
        to sacrifice to its ruling passion or interest both the public good and
        the rights of other citizens. To secure the public good and private
        rights against the danger of such a faction, and at the same time to
        preserve the spirit and the form of popular government, is then the
        great object to which our inquiries are directed. Let me add that it is
        the great desideratum by which this form of government can be rescued
        from the opprobrium under which it has so long labored, and be
        recommended to the esteem and adoption of mankind.
      </p>

      <p>
        By what means is this object attainable? Evidently by one of two only.
        Either the existence of the same passion or interest in a majority at
        the same time must be prevented, or the majority, having such coexistent
        passion or interest, must be rendered, by their number and local
        situation, unable to concert and carry into effect schemes of
        oppression. If the impulse and the opportunity be suffered to coincide,
        we well know that neither moral nor religious motives can be relied on
        as an adequate control. They are not found to be such on the injustice
        and violence of individuals, and lose their efficacy in proportion to
        the number combined together, that is, in proportion as their efficacy
        becomes needful.
      </p>

        From this view of the subject it may be concluded that a pure democracy,
        by which I mean a society consisting of a small number of citizens, who
        assemble and administer the government in person, can admit of no cure
        for the mischiefs of faction. A common passion or interest will, in
        almost every case, be felt by a majority of the whole; a communication
        and concert result from the form of government itself; and there is
        nothing to check the inducements to sacrifice the weaker party or an
        obnoxious individual. Hence it is that such democracies have ever been
        spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found
        incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have
        in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in
        their deaths. Theoretic politicians, who have patronized this species of
        government, have erroneously supposed that by reducing mankind to a
        perfect equality in their political rights, they would, at the same
        time, be perfectly equalized and assimilated in their possessions, their
        opinions, and their passions.

        A republic, by which I mean a government in which the scheme of
        representation takes place, opens a different prospect, and promises the
        cure for which we are seeking. Let us examine the points in which it
        varies from pure democracy, and we shall comprehend both the nature of
        the cure and the efficacy which it must derive from the Union.
      </p>

      <p>
        The two great points of difference between a democracy and a republic
        are: first, the delegation of the government, in the latter, to a small
        number of citizens elected by the rest; secondly, the greater number of
        citizens, and greater sphere of country, over which the latter may be
        extended.
      </p>

      <p>
        The effect of the first difference is, on the one hand, to refine and
        enlarge the public views, by passing them through the medium of a chosen
        body of citizens, whose wisdom may best discern the true interest of
        their country, and whose patriotism and love of justice will be least
        likely to sacrifice it to temporary or partial considerations. Under
        such a regulation, it may well happen that the public voice, pronounced
        by the representatives of the people, will be more consonant to the
        public good than if pronounced by the people themselves, convened for
        the purpose. On the other hand, the effect may be inverted. Men of
        factious tempers, of local prejudices, or of sinister designs, may, by
        intrigue, by corruption, or by other means, first obtain the suffrages,
        and then betray the interests, of the people. The question resulting is,
        whether small or extensive republics are more favorable to the election
        of proper guardians of the public weal; and it is clearly decided in
        favor of the latter by two obvious considerations:
      </p>

      <p>
        In the first place, it is to be remarked that, however small the
        republic may be, the representatives must be raised to a certain number,
        in order to guard against the cabals of a few; and that, however large
        it may be, they must be limited to a certain number, in order to guard
        against the confusion of a multitude. Hence, the number of
        representatives in the two cases not being in proportion to that of the
        two constituents, and being proportionally greater in the small
        republic, it follows that, if the proportion of fit characters be not
        less in the large than in the small republic, the former will present a
        greater option, and consequently a greater probability of a fit choice.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the next place, as each representative will be chosen by a greater
        number of citizens in the large than in the small republic, it will be
        more difficult for unworthy candidates to practice with success the
        vicious arts by which elections are too often carried; and the suffrages
        of the people being more free, will be more likely to centre in men who
        possess the most attractive merit and the most diffusive and established
        characters.
      </p>

      <p>
        It must be confessed that in this, as in most other cases, there is a
        mean, on both sides of which inconveniences will be found to lie. By
        enlarging too much the number of electors, you render the
        representatives too little acquainted with all their local circumstances
        and lesser interests; as by reducing it too much, you render him unduly
        attached to these, and too little fit to comprehend and pursue great and
        national objects. The federal Constitution forms a happy combination in
        this respect; the great and aggregate interests being referred to the
        national, the local and particular to the State legislatures.
      </p>

      <p>
        The other point of difference is, the greater number of citizens and
        extent of territory which may be brought within the compass of
        republican than of democratic government; and it is this circumstance
        principally which renders factious combinations less to be dreaded in
        the former than in the latter. The smaller the society, the fewer
        probably will be the distinct parties and interests composing it; the
        fewer the distinct parties and interests, the more frequently will a
        majority be found of the same party; and the smaller the number of
        individuals composing a majority, and the smaller the compass within
        which they are placed, the more easily will they concert and execute
        their plans of oppression. Extend the sphere, and you take in a greater
        variety of parties and interests; you make it less probable that a
        majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of
        other citizens; or if such a common motive exists, it will be more
        difficult for all who feel it to discover their own strength, and to act
        in unison with each other. Besides other impediments, it may be remarked
        that, where there is a consciousness of unjust or dishonorable purposes,
        communication is always checked by distrust in proportion to the number
        whose concurrence is necessary.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hence, it clearly appears, that the same advantage which a republic has
        over a democracy, in controlling the effects of faction, is enjoyed by a
        large over a small republic,--is enjoyed by the Union over the States
        composing it. Does the advantage consist in the substitution of
        representatives whose enlightened views and virtuous sentiments render
        them superior to local prejudices and schemes of injustice? It will not
        be denied that the representation of the Union will be most likely to
        possess these requisite endowments. Does it consist in the greater
        security afforded by a greater variety of parties, against the event of
        any one party being able to outnumber and oppress the rest? In an equal
        degree does the increased variety of parties comprised within the Union,
        increase this security. Does it, in fine, consist in the greater
        obstacles opposed to the concert and accomplishment of the secret wishes
        of an unjust and interested majority? Here, again, the extent of the
        Union gives it the most palpable advantage.
      </p>

      <p>
        The influence of factious leaders may kindle a flame within their
        particular States, but will be unable to spread a general conflagration
        through the other States. A religious sect may degenerate into a
        political faction in a part of the Confederacy; but the variety of sects
        dispersed over the entire face of it must secure the national councils
        against any danger from that source. A rage for paper money, for an
        abolition of debts, for an equal division of property, or for any other
        improper or wicked project, will be less apt to pervade the whole body
        of the Union than a particular member of it; in the same proportion as
        such a malady is more likely to taint a particular county or district,
        than an entire State.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the extent and proper structure of the Union, therefore, we behold a
        republican remedy for the diseases most incident to republican
        government. And according to the degree of pleasure and pride we feel in
        being republicans, ought to be our zeal in cherishing the spirit and
        supporting the character of Federalists.
